# Authentication Fix for Job Creation

## Problem Identified ✅

**Issue**: Postman worked for job creation, but frontend returned "Not Authorised, login again" error.

**Root Cause**: The frontend was trying to use an unauthenticated endpoint, but the proper job creation flow requires company authentication through JWT tokens.

## Solution Implemented ✅

### 1. Fixed Authentication Flow
The application uses a **company-based authentication system** where:
- Companies register/login through `/api/company/register` and `/api/company/login`
- JWT tokens are issued and stored in localStorage
- Jobs are created through the authenticated `/api/company/post-job` endpoint
- The `protectCompany` middleware validates the token before allowing job creation

### 2. Frontend Authentication Fixes

#### **RecruiterLogin Component** (`client/src/components/RecruiterLogin.jsx`)
**Before**: Login form wasn't sending credentials or storing tokens
**After**: 
- ✅ Sends email/password to `/api/company/login`
- ✅ Stores JWT token in localStorage and context
- ✅ Handles both login and registration flows
- ✅ Proper error handling and user feedback

#### **AppContext** (`client/src/context/AppContext.jsx`)
**Before**: Token wasn't persisted across browser sessions
**After**:
- ✅ Loads token from localStorage on app start
- ✅ Provides token to all components that need it

#### **AddJob Component** (`client/src/components/AddJob.jsx`)
**Before**: Called unauthenticated endpoint without token
**After**:
- ✅ Checks for authentication before allowing job creation
- ✅ Uses authenticated `/api/company/post-job` endpoint
- ✅ Includes JWT token in request headers
- ✅ Shows login prompt when not authenticated
- ✅ Handles token expiry gracefully

### 3. Backend Authentication System

#### **Middleware**: `server/middleware/authMiddleware.js`
```javascript
// Expects 'token' header with JWT
const token = req.header('token')
// Validates token and attaches company to req.company
```

#### **Protected Routes**: `server/routes/companyRoutes.js`
```javascript
// All job-related operations require authentication
router.post("/post-job", protectCompany, postJob)
router.get("/list-jobs", protectCompany, getCompanyPostedJobs)
router.post("/change-visibility", protectCompany, changeJobVisibility)
```

## How It Works Now ✅

### Authentication Flow:
1. **Company Registration/Login**:
   ```
   POST /api/company/login
   Body: { email, password }
   Response: { success: true, token: "jwt_token", message: company_data }
   ```

2. **Token Storage**:
   - JWT stored in localStorage: `companyToken`
   - Available in React context for all components

3. **Authenticated Job Creation**:
   ```
   POST /api/company/post-job
   Headers: { token: "jwt_token" }
   Body: { title, description, location, category, level, salary }
   ```

4. **Middleware Validation**:
   - `protectCompany` validates JWT token
   - Attaches company info to `req.company`
   - Job is created with `companyId: req.company._id`

## API Endpoints Summary

### Authentication:
- `POST /api/company/register` - Company registration
- `POST /api/company/login` - Company login

### Jobs (Authenticated):
- `POST /api/company/post-job` - Create job (requires token)
- `GET /api/company/list-jobs` - Get company's jobs (requires token)

### Jobs (Public):
- `GET /api/jobs/` - Get all visible jobs
- `GET /api/jobs/:id` - Get single job by ID

## Testing the Fix ✅

### 1. Start the servers:
```bash
# Backend
cd server && npm run server

# Frontend  
cd client && npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Authentication:
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/dashboard/add-job`
2. Should see "Please login to add a job" message
3. Click "Login as Recruiter"
4. Register or login with company credentials
5. Should be redirected back to add job form

### 3. Test Job Creation:
1. Fill out the job form
2. Click "ADD" button
3. Should see "Job created successfully!" message
4. Job should be saved to MongoDB with proper company association

### 4. Verify in Database:
```javascript
// Jobs should have companyId field properly set
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  title: "Job Title",
  description: "Description",
  companyId: ObjectId("company_id"), // ✅ Properly associated
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Error Handling ✅

### Frontend:
- **No token**: Shows login prompt
- **Invalid/expired token**: Clears localStorage, shows login
- **Network errors**: Shows generic error message

### Backend:
- **No token**: "Not Authorised, login again"
- **Invalid token**: "Not Authorised, company not found"
- **Missing fields**: "Missing Details"

## Security Features ✅

1. **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based auth
2. **Token Validation**: Middleware validates every request
3. **Company Association**: Jobs linked to authenticated company
4. **Auto Logout**: Expired tokens trigger re-authentication
5. **Protected Routes**: All job creation requires valid authentication

## Files Modified

### Frontend:
- `client/src/components/RecruiterLogin.jsx` - Fixed auth logic
- `client/src/components/AddJob.jsx` - Added auth integration  
- `client/src/context/AppContext.jsx` - Token persistence

### Backend:
- `server/controllers/jobController.js` - Removed unused createJob
- `server/routes/jobRoutes.js` - Removed unauthenticated route

## Current Status ✅

- ✅ Authentication system working properly
- ✅ Job creation requires login
- ✅ JWT tokens properly validated
- ✅ Frontend/backend integration complete
- ✅ Error handling implemented
- ✅ Token persistence across sessions
- ✅ Postman vs Frontend parity achieved

The "Not Authorised, login again" error has been resolved by implementing proper authentication flow!
